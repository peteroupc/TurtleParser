# com.upokecenter.rdf.ParserException

    public final class ParserException extends RuntimeException

<p>Exception thrown for errors that occur while parsing data. </p> <p>This
 library may throw exceptions of this type in certain cases, notably when
 errors occur, and may supply messages to those exceptions (the message can
 be accessed through the <code>Message</code> property in.NET or the <code>
 getMessage()</code> method in Java). These messages are intended to be read by
 humans to help diagnose the error (or other cause of the exception); they
 are not intended to be parsed by computer programs, and the exact text of
 the messages may change at any time between versions of this library.</p>
